* Dired
** Config

Part of standard emacs, no config needed, although imagemagick is
needed to show thumbnails and images.

** Usage

*** General

| Keybinding | Description                        |
|------------+------------------------------------|
| =C-x d=    | Opens dired mode                   |
| =g=        | Refresh dired buffer               |
| =n=, =C-n= | Move point down a listing          |
| =p=, =C-p= | Move point up a listing            |
| =q=        | Quit dired mode                    |
|------------+------------------------------------|
| =RET=      | Open selected file or directory    |
| =+=        | Insert new Directory               |
| =i=        | Show contents of sub-directory     |
| =^=        | Go to parent directory             |
| =f=        | Open selected file                 |
| =o=        | Open selected file in other window |
| =s=        | Toggle sorting by name / date      |
| =<=, =>=   | Jumps to prev/next directory       |
| j          | Jumps to file                      |
|------------+------------------------------------|

Since I have activated =IDO-mode=, I can type =C-d= when finding files with =C-x
C-f= to open a dired buffer in that file's directory.

When you press =RET= in a directory, a /new/ dired buffer is opened, so pressing
=q= after visiting

Typing =i= on a directory in dired inserts the sub directory in the same dired
buffer. This enables you to mark files in =/fiets/= but also in =/fiets/bel/= at
the same time.

*** Marking & Unmarking

| Keybinding | Description        |
|------------+--------------------|
| =m=        | Marks active       |
| =u=        | Unmarks active     |
| =U=        | Unmarks everything |
| =d=        | Flags for deletion |
|------------+--------------------|

Marks are never affected by the delete command and vice versa, except for one
command that deletes marked files.

*** Mark specific things

| Keybinding | Description              |
|------------+--------------------------|
| =* m=      | Marks region             |
| =* u=      | Unmarks region           |
| =* %=      | Marks files by regexp    |
| =* .=      | Marks files by extension |
| =t=, =* t= | Toggles marking          |
| =* c=      | Changes mark             |
|------------+--------------------------|

*** Operations

| Keybinding | Description                           |
|------------+---------------------------------------|
| =C=        | Copy file(s)                          |
| =R=        | Rename or move files                  |
|------------+---------------------------------------|
| =D=        | Deletes /marked/ (shown as *)         |
| =x=        | Deletes /flagged/ (shown as D)        |
|------------+---------------------------------------|
| =O=        | Change owner                          |
| =G=        | Change group                          |
| =M=        | Change mode (permissions) of files(s) |
|------------+---------------------------------------|
| =c=        | Compress marked to a file             |
| =Z=        | Zip or unZip file(s)                  |
|------------+---------------------------------------|

*** Create new file

This works inside and outside a dired buffer:

| Keybinding                  | Description                                       |
|-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| =C-x C-f <your-filename>=   | Find file (or create one if it doesn't yet exist) |
| =M-! touch <your-filename>= | Simply run the touch shell cmd                    |
|-----------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|

*** Finding files and directories
**** Find with a pattern

=M-x find-dired=

Asks for a starting directory and runs the =find= command with the arguments you
provide. So for instance to find all files ending with the extension .org in and
under ~/Projects:

- =M-x find-dired=
- ~/Projects
- -name '*.org'

And the results are shown in a new buffer where you can navigate to one of the
found org files and open it by pressing =RET=.

**** Find by name

=M-x find-name-dired=

Reads arguments /directory/ and /pattern/ and shows all the files in
/directory/ or its subdirectories whose individual names match
/pattern/.

So to find all .org files in directory ~/Projects and its
sub-directories:

- =M-x find-name-dired=
- ~/Projects
- *.org
- Put cursor on file you were looking for
- =RET=

Similar to =find= with =-name=

**** Find text in file

=M-x find-grep-dired=

Reads arguments /directory/ and /regexp/ and shows all the files in
/directory/ or its sub-directories that contain a match for /regexp/.

So to find the file(s) which contain the text 'directory' in
~/Projects/emacs and its sub-directories:

- =M-x find-grep-dired=
- ~/Projects
- directory

*** Viewing image thumbnails

=M-x image-dired=

Reads argument /directory/, finds image files within that directory
and shows thumbnails of those images.

You can select the thumbnails one by one and typing =RET= will display
a sized version of the image in another buffer.
