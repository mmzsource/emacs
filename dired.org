*** Create new file

This works inside and outside a dired buffer:

| Keybinding                | Description                                       |
|---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| C-x C-f <your-filename>   | Find file (or create one if it doesn't yet exist) |
| M-! touch <your-filename> | Simply run the touch shell cmd                    |
|---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|


*** Find by name

M-x find-name-dired

Reads arguments /directory/ and /pattern/ and shows all the files in
/directory/ or its subdirectories whose individual names match
/pattern/.

So to find all .org files in directory ~/Projects and its
subdirectories:

- M-x find-name-dired
- ~/Projects
- *.org
- Put cursor on file you were looking for
- RET


*** Find text in file

M-x find-grep-dired

Reads arguments /directory/ and /regexp/ and shows all the files in
/directory/ or its subdirectories that contain a match for /regexp/.

So to find the file(s) which contain the text 'directory' in
~/Projects/emacs and its subdirectories:

- M-x find-grep-dired
- ~/Projects
- directory


*** Viewing image thumbnails

M-x image-dired

Reads argument /directory/, finds image files within that directory
and shows thumbnails of those images.

You can select the thumbnails one by one and typing <RET> will display
a sized version of the image in another buffer.
