** Usage


C-x / <key for your engine here> for invoking engine-mode

If your cursor is on a word when invoking engine-mode, that word will
be the default search value unless you overwrite it by typing another
search term.

If you have selected a piece of text (C-SPC ...) and invoke
engine-mode, that piece of text will be your search string.

So for instance I want to search for "emil ernebro" on youtube:

- C-x / y
- type "emil ernebro"
- engine-mode will open youtube and search for emil ernebro

Other way to search for "emil ernebro", this time on google-images:

- Select "emil ernebro" in the current textbuffer
- C-x / i
