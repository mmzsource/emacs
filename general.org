General out-of-the-box emacs information gathered from multiple sources.

* =C= & =M=

The =C= or control key (as for instance in =C-h=) is the ctrl key
The =M= or Meta key (as for instance in =M-f=) is the alt key

Very often Meta characters are used for operations related to the units defined
by language (words, sentences, paragraphs), while Control characters operate on
basic units that are independent of what you are editing (characters, lines,
etc). For example:

| Keybinding | Description                   |
|------------+-------------------------------|
| =C-f=      | Forward one cursor position   |
| =M-f=      | Forward one word              |
| =C-b=      | Backward one cursor position  |
| =M-b=      | Backward one word             |
| =C-a=      | Move to beginning of line     |
| =M-a=      | Move to beginning of sentence |
| =C-e=      | Move to end of line           |
| =M-e=      | Move to end of sentence       |

* Help

Because I have installed =which-key=, key bindings following the currently typed
incomplete command will display the next possible keys in a popup. So typing
=C-h= will give you all possible help functions (bound to a key).

Furthermore, because I have installed =smex= there will be autocompletion for
commands when using =M-x=. So typing =M-x= and then typing (parts of) your
command, will quickly reveal your options. The selected function's keybinding
can be found (in smex) with =C-h w= and it's documentation can be found with
=C-h f=.

A couple of often used help bindings:

| =C-h C-h=              | help for help                                   |
|------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
| =C-h k= =<keybinding>= | display information about the =<keybinding>=    |
| =C-h m=                | view documentation on the current major mode    |
| =C-h f= =<function>=   | describe =<function>=                           |
| =C-h a= =<keyword>=    | list all commands containing =<keyword>=        |
| =C-h v=                | check value of a variable (e.g. user-init-file) |
| =C-h b=                | list all key bindings                           |
|------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|

* Stop

| keybinding | description                                           |
|------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| =C-x C-c=  | Stop emacs session (emacs asks which buffers to save) |
| =C-g=      | Discard a command you do not want to finish           |
| =C-g=      | Stop the execution of long running command            |
